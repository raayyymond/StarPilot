"""NetworkManager lease for the head unit's projection Wi-Fi.

The lease creates one volatile, never-default connection profile named
``starpilot-starport``, activates it on the Wi-Fi device, and on release
deactivates and deletes only that profile and reactivates whatever Wi-Fi
connection was active before -- unless the user switched networks meanwhile.
Credentials travel over D-Bus only; they never appear in argv or logs. The
cellular default route and DNS are left alone (``never-default``,
``ignore-auto-dns``) so the car's local network cannot take over Internet traffic.
