  # OTTOCAST (Wi-Fi "CAR2-xxxx"), 2020 Honda Accord, 2026-10-28..11-02 over 43 projections. The Honda grants the screen
  # if and only if its own hands-free link to the comma is up (24 of 24 once the Bluetooth channel was open): it then
  # answers the pairing request twice with status 1 and hands over within a second, whether that link came up before
  # the connection or 38 s into it. How fast the dongle answered never mattered. So: open the Bluetooth channel like a
  # phone (phone_services), keep the car's hands-free link up (hfp_gate), and stop paying for the old theory (no
  # negotiate delay, no native-screen reconnects). The dongle restarts its handshake ~12 s after sending its network;
  # an unpinned first join (hidden-SSID scan, median 6.5 s, up to 11.4 s) ran into that on every session, so pin the
  # remembered channel and answer a restart during setup instead of waiting for the dead TCP endpoint. Everything
  # below is the operator's set for that dongle and applies to no other adapter.
  # Video window (2026-11-02 drives, session logs 27/28): the Accord offers a window of 4 and the stream ran at a steady
  # 7 fps whenever its acknowledgements took ~280 ms with only 2 frames in flight (fps = window / ack latency), while the
  # renderer and encoder kept 30 fps. Use the car's full window; the ACK timeout still catches a silent receiver.
  # Silent links (2026-11-04..13, sessions 37-56): in 7 of 20 drives the Honda's first Bluetooth link at ignition came up
  # and then carried nothing, and the Honda held it for 68.2 s before calling again (twice it took three such links,
  # 221-228 s to the screen). A working link has its hands-free up within half a second, so hang a silent one up
  # (recycle_silent_link) instead of waiting out the car's timer. Whether the Honda calls back as fast after the comma
  # hangs up as after its own hang-up is not known yet: "companion_link_recycled" and the next hfp_connected show it.
  # The join (same 19 sessions): 6.2 s at the median, 5.4-13.9, on a channel already pinned; the dongle leased the same
  # address every time. remember_wifi_address joins with that address and checks the dongle answers from it, falling
  # back to DHCP within 1.5 s if it does not. Not driven yet: "wifi_joined address_source=remembered" shows it worked.
