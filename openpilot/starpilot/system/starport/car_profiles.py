  # if and only if its own hands-free link to the comma is up (24 of 24 once the Bluetooth channel was open): it then
  # answers the pairing request twice with status 1 and hands over within a second, whether that link came up before
  # the connection or 38 s into it. How fast the dongle answered never mattered. So: open the Bluetooth channel like a
  # phone (phone_services), keep the car's hands-free link up (hfp_gate), and stop paying for the old theory (no
  # negotiate delay, no native-screen reconnects). The dongle restarts its handshake ~12 s after sending its network;
  # an unpinned first join (hidden-SSID scan, median 6.5 s, up to 11.4 s) ran into that on every session, so pin the
  # remembered channel and answer a restart during setup instead of waiting for the dead TCP endpoint. Everything
  # below is the operator's set for that dongle and applies to no other adapter.
